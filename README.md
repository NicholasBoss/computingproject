# computingproject
 
## Introduction
Each week of the project will be separated into each folder with instructions in a README.md file on how to complete each week.

## [Week 1](week1/README.md)
In the first week of the project we will create the database and tables that will be used throughout the project. The database will be created using SQLite3 and the tables will be created using SQL. The tables will be created in a way that will allow us to store the data that we will be using throughout the project.

## [Week 2](week2/README.md)
In week 2, we will write python code that will allow us to create our project database.

## [Week 3](week3/README.md)
In week 3, we will write python code that will allow us to insert data into the `user` table.

## [Week 4](week4/README.md)
In week 4, we will write python code that will allow us to insert data into the `project` and `user_project` tables.

## [Week 5](week5/README.md)
In week 5, we will write python code that will allow us to update our project data.

## [Week 6](week6/README.md)
In week 6, we will write python code that will allow us to delete data from our project.

## [Week 7](week7/README.md) & [Week 8](week8/README.md)
In weeks 7 and 8, we will write python code that will allow us to query our project data and assign credentialed users to the database.
